And what you have done today -
Happy to agree.

Even better for second;
No other damage.

A sad truth of the world
It is everywhere

For $7


Stunned by life's wonder?
Philosophers, and kids, are.
Childlike - or childish?


Barbecue in de terrein
Vertel me wat drank je wilt
Dus - "Ik wil niet doen"



"Be kind to yourself"
Nothing to do with kindness-
it's 'Respond in kind'.


I'm an actuary.
Reality's confusion,
To die by Numbers.


The big bang theory
all must cross the river Styx-
to the brave new world


Terry Pratchett asked, "What is there in this world that truly makes living worthwhile?"

I don't like haiku

wrong haiku website



Happiness has gone
Loneliness wants to come in.
Shouldn't I let her in?


Triscuits in a bowl.
Queso in the pot: almost done.
Time to watch some sports


Cigarette in hand
storm of darkness almost gone
What is the meaning


Show me the way Lord,
cause I'm about to explode.
I'll carry your world.


Mountains are calling
Snow-capped peaks seem to whisper
"Come, there is peace here"


Dawn of a new day
How wonderful you do sound
Perfect, no mistakes

It's essence the Tao


She is a kisser,
who is never caught not,
kissing a dull hat



Mad men missed a
day of miss matches, you do
not want to see too.


The dead man was not,
a tool that could not be
used for a the day.


Earth is our mother
She gives us all that we eat-
yet we throw down trash


Spores ride rays of light
touching down, they sprout new life-
proof there are others


Ceaseless energy
a force that animates life-
it prefers to spin

Velvety green blades

Small rounded wooden knobs

Green snake swims in lake
I see, scream loud very scared
Snake freezes silent

Birds at the feeder,
Flitting, fighting for a perch.
Seed rains to the dirt.


Tokkuri of life,

How many sweet drops remain?


autumn dawn
no dark in the garden
only true colours


little eye
but blue and vast 
ocean sky 


amazing sunrise
no cloud ragging in the blue
smile the eyes 


new fiscal year
rainbow in the sunset
no black budget 


working day
sleeping the urban heart
crying crow


Ignorance is bliss.
But when the mask is inside
That's willful blindness.

Staining a house,
the smell of paint thinner
and--I forgot


Haiku are the best,
But sometimes it can be hard
to find the right words
But once you finally do,
the words will flow like magic.


Haikus are awesome,
but sometimes they don't make sense.

Symbols of Autumn
Hibiscus gently swaying -
Morning dew sparkles. 


In single file-
how determined the ants march,
to unseen wars


Seeking penance
the dew on the flower,
after the storm


During summer,
even the sunlight enjoys
floating on waves


"Subtle is the Lord,
but malicious He is not."
- Herr Albert Einstein





"For us who believe:
the past, present and future
are an illusion."



God is a Female
Her voice made Universes-
to know Her is Love


Fall ends to winter
Life is lost to snow and frost
With no sorrow felt


Stars, twinkling above
So far away do they sit
Yet they touch my heart

Lunches can be packed
Lunches can be from the school.
Lunches are so good.


Orange eyes in the trees
suddenly, they spot movement-
without noise, talons strike


Did you love seeing
me on my knees, crying
like I needed you.


An old tree is that
man.  Older than a rock or
a diamond


Sit and wonder on
my thoughts of and about you
I think not of you


great grey mustache smiles
weathered fingers plucking strings
young voices inspire


Such beautiful Skies,
Clouds-Stars-Suns, shining, sparkling
Misery beneath.


Emails fly, but I do think
I'll not give first blink.

Feathers of the forest
growing like clouds on the ground-
natures medicine


Erased art leaves lines
like ghosts left to haunt the page
and the next new sketch

A fountain hidden
Ponce De Leon searched for it-
it was never stone 


sound and silence
space and form
within the mind
all time is born...


Clouds 
The dreams
Of ocean and rock

Moving In the mind
Light and shadow
Moving with the tide
Of knowing And Not knowing 


Being here
With the sound
Of gulls
On this quiet sea...


Love is what I feel
when heart beats like an
abused drum.  I know


So soft is your heart
you don't see how hurtful
people can be


Summer, distant land
Long journey, distant city
Radiating life –
I find her, emitting light
A bundle of energy



Hot, metropolis
A tale to be told, work to do
In the toil, she shines –
Luminous for I who see
A bright beacon left behind


Are you like saying
that you are the girl of my
dreams  


Happier feelings 
for happier occasions.
but what about now?


I'm terrified of
the day I let you in, please
dont shatter my heart


what they told us
"Be yourself" and then
"be who we want you to be"
what did you not like?


Write a haiku:
One line, seven syllables,
And two lines of five.


On top was she who
is more than nice to
me she say.


I believe that
that nice girl is
all mine


Don't or do
not forget about me
tomorrow


What do I mean
to you now that you
are good


Oh my love is
only for you and you alone
my love


I like your
pretty face on a day like
this


I like you in the
morning when you wake up
you look so pretty


I don't know a
more beautiful girl than
you


Don't break my
heart with a no, just say
yes and only yes


I promise to
love you forever if you
love me too


Don't take me
wrong, I do love girls
I love you more


Today I am weak
like a man in love with a
witch. But I'm not.


See me on the
wrong side of the road  and
love me with real love


I missed her only
for a day, but I was still
love with her


She thought that
a morning round was
good sex for the day


She said I'm lonely
Because I am the most clever
she had ever seen


Only a clever guy
Knows about those kinds
of things


She likes my
smile but hates to
please me


A day is ending
and a year is beginning
for all of us here


My life will not be
the same tomorrow. I will
be a real kill joy


Two times I was
with her. And two times I
was not with her


Draw me as monster
and draw my girl as a nice
lady who like it


Good guys won't die
new year, they have fun with
good girls and more


Upon turning you
saw heaven and you short
down to die


See life see it all
Make love make life for all to
see


A sphere of metal
somehow you do not rotate-
from inside they watch



Massive egg of time
a mother bird gave you life -
her feathers spawned worlds


Space is not empty
a fabric that can't be touched -
yet it can be bent


On that day she said
I love you. On that day I
flew like a bird


I am in love and
I am loving being
in love





Like a fool I
waited for love, and now I
have love


Good Goddess of
sweets got her grace from just
living that way


I have fought
against white domination
I have fought


Let there be peace
between us as men and
as fighters



I am her man and
she is my only friend in
this world


Don't cry when I am
gone. But live and remember
for my work


I was a slave now
I am free to live for all
those who love me


The day I die let
no one stand between
me and heaven

I am likable
to you only because you
are not stupid

bouncy, big or firm, tight
Size d or slight
Damn i need a woman
Of that feminine touch, I am a fan.

To some I am
just stupid. And to others
I am me cool

On your day happy
fiftieth birthday mom
enjoy your day


Waliking alone
I realised that my life
was fucked up


I live like I want
to live because thats life
when you die


On top of things
she was when she smiled
at me

Dineo
She looks and is
the girl that I should be
with


She is my friend
the one who is out there for
only me she says


I like her only for
her smile her laugh her
looks and all that.


In battle you have
two choices that matter,
Live or die


In life seeing
everything is not that
important



Be fearless when
facing your enemies and
others like them



Like women and
hate men who are bad to you
good to other


A man is not a
Bear but something else
just a man


I woke up when it
was time for it to be like
that for me out there


A taste of what
she tastes like is all I
wanted from her


She is the one for
me. But she is too bad to
be with now


I just wanted to
live alone. And then you came
with your ideas


How many people
live under rocks not
wanted by others


I am here to be
a builder of worlds and
protect myself


The book of legions
says we are many but in end
there can be only one


P=10 J
Z=26 77
God is here

I did and you said
You must not radom
cock sucker

I have been to
prison so many times
It hurt not back there


Add me your God to
your world and you will see
the world's beauty


I came here from a
world where vampires are
kings for life


Be a man or be
yourself and have sex
with girls


I don't live like
there is no tomorrow
there is


I like her face but
not her mouth when it 
speaks


Who is the ruler
not who but the ruler of
earth the planet


I was once tall and
now I am too short to be
seen here


I am alone and like
to be unique, because its
fun that way


You will never be
me even if you take my
wife you.


The order came
straight from the top
live good


Don't be like that
Be good like others like you
are related


Be good to good,
and bad to bad is how life
should be


In life there is
good and there is bad But the
life is too good


I live for today
But I also like to what the
next day brings


I am loving
someone who wants to
see me dead


I am in love all
by myself, I need a girl
who loves me


I like gentle
soft music for me, but for
my girl sex is all

night walking on lake
and only scream of the swan
over screen of dusk


My love for you is
pink like my heart when the
blood is washed.


My girl is my girl
but when she angry she is
someone else's.


I like to walk                                             
I do it alone not only
that I like it so     


she dances but
she doesn't like to
dance alone


I walk to live but
I die everyday as
I walk to live here


She is the one I
love, but she is very bad
and so good


He walks like
a king with a bad knee
with no shame


pipe down, tiny gnome
get off of my lower back
cheese makes me cheese cheese



I wake up
I see the life
It goes on


Death to the one
who argues with me
in this house


Shag me please in rhyme
Poetic licentiousness
Haiku aaaahhh fuck me


Nothing beat her smile
in the morning when I wake
up next to her



She's got the most

beautiful smile in the world

and I love her

Sipping lattes and writing

pretentious haiku.

You can't even count.

After "Once upon a time",

comes your chance to make

"happily ever after".



The crowd surges round

the woman pushing her cart.

She was someone's child.



The air conditioner hums;

sedated by cold,

the summer passes us by.

Wandering through the mountains,

I seek solitude

and hear symphonies instead.



Sending out more resumes;

Fifty and female,

Hopeless and invisible.

Overflowing love,

She is always serving

Others, not herself.

big hand of clock moves forward

The sounds of the waves,

Holding your hand and mine, blue.

Eternities, swift.

‘Did you bring the flag?’

asked Neil. ‘No, you said you had

packed it’, Buzz glared back.

‘And here are your gloves!’

Dave’s 1 year old stood in goal.

Dave took a run up.

“Don’t waste eggs,” said John.

But Jack just loved cracking them.

“It’s the sound,” he said.

The bath overflowed.

Bob suggested Anne get out.

Simon got out too.

‘Brilliant!’ said John.

It was clear John had no clue

what kidney stones were.

Drawn in through lips
Soul leaves this body
Wisps of smoke.....

what of it that this spring day
undeniably sun?

Hobbits

Short, merry people

They shy away from "Big Folk"

Halfling hole-builders

Dwarves

Beards, long and bushy

Standing stern and unyeilding

Mighty axe-wielders 

Elves

Immortal beings

Bowmanship unparalleled

Both agile and wise

Dragons

Their scales glinting bright

Flying high above the world

Fantasies in flight

Coming Storms

Rain, a distant haze

Clouds hang on the horizon

Thunder overhead

Owls

Eyes held wide, watching

They glide on swift, silent wings

Mysteries in flight

Castles

Vast stronghold of stone 

Never cleaved by axe nor sword

Standing evermore

Warriors

Swords beat on shields

Spears glinting in the bright sun

Marching to battle

Trees

Arms reach for the sky

Strong roots break through rock and earth

Leaves sway in the breeze

I AM The Monster That Walks

Made By Loved Ones

Their Love Was An Illusion

The Unloved Heart

Hardest Stone

Melts With A Glance

The Stone Waits Alone

The Sand Is Patient

Poplar Branch Bends

Sparrows Weight

Now Spring Comes Late

I saw you in your mother
You were amazing

In a spiritual drought,

Lost in fear and doubt?

Without love, there’s no way out.

After long days, I like to get naked,

and watch nickleodeon. 

thank you, Mr Trey Songz

for making music

and her panties drop. 

Sad moonlight gazing,

Shining dimly landscape blues,

Swing dancing aloof.

A ghastly feeling,
Peering through the muddy glass.
Knock, knock. Are you home?

I'll dance wistfully,

Thinking of the swaying sea,

I swim on the floor

Silent and still

outside: calm and clear like a mask

inside: wild and thorny, with no restraints

Smile plastered or smirk hidden

which side will win

Murder is murder

No matter the position

Fetus or felon

Nonfiction is true

Fiction is like butterflies

Flying away now 

Arguing with peers.

About things they do not know.

I know, sure I do.

watching into shrine
at the snow-flower petals
trace of conductors

The flower is still

The wind has long been dispersed

The summer remains

Aerobic for me.

Anaerobic for my beer.

Respiration now.

As I gaze again

Time passes like butterflies 

Floating in the wind 

Shooting through the stars,

The aliens attacking,

I grab my laser!

Swaqqer's what I got!

I got so many friends see!

You don't believe it?

I am just a man.

I am not anyone's hero.

I walk all alone.

Sniffing in the snow,

nose pressed to the frozen ground,

where is that damn bone?



Write a haunting verse.

Something that captures your soul,

And won't let you go.

I am thankful

now the holiday is past.

I can breathe again.

Happy Turkey Day!

said the fatted Easter calf,

not knowing his fate.

I grew up believing

In monsters, fairies, anything

Just not God

She stumbles and chokes

Laughter invades her ears

She runs and never stops

Your digits are gone
Old phone wouldn't turn on
Needs resurrection

the heavy night falls

true love is tested in time

lust equals failure

The soft summer winds

flow through me to remind me

how thankful I am



Summer has faded

Leaves reveal gold and crimson

Fall has now begun

Cool summer evening
People relax and have fun
Work can wait for now

bin blank

full of blank

till garbage jump out

thunder drowns

the twilight-blue dawn

stirring me from

stormy dreams

of you

What can be done now?

Monsters live atop the world

Ghost within our brow...

Political ads -

Require suspended thought

and thoughtless suspense.











My house is foreclosed.

My employer laid me off.

My vote means nothing.



Today we escape,

Escape from this paranoia,

From a world gone mad.

The hungry cat

watching so intently;

the carp feeding

The river

slowly disappearing--

still no rain

Delicate and bright

the flowering redbud tree:

memories of you.

This hot drought-

how the grass crunches

under foot!

Sun rays beam

on other side of earth

span of hibernate,

prevail my world.

Lucent moon

cover me blissful.

Shown me sign,

though you are away.

sugar castle melts

moat of cream, black coffee rain

pie completes my dream

Give me one
I'll give you three,
I love to repay,
Where is the focus? 

child in distress

under diress

coughing up thoughts of younger days

pasty white

thundering in the wind

you guessed it, my thighs

rain stopped for a while –
tired with the drops’ patter,
roses’ petals doze

I am a white soul,

full of holes, red and black stains.

I was an Angel.

This is a haiku

The last statement was a lie

I am a liar

Solitary flesh

Depression stalks barren soul

Spring sun sets anew

White stork flies away

A lake surmounted with stars

There do my thoughts lie

Shadows dance in fire

Shrouded by the waving trees

The night had arisen

Sunbeams bounce through glass

Reflect off the pool within;

Water of my soul

Small bird on window

Trilling out tunes of springtime

Singing my heart's song



Dancing by the moon

Jewel studded beach sand gleaming

Like dark waters below



Acid trip

Through countryside roads

Bat country never so blue

I sleep

then awake

still it is now

scorching sands

brushed by time

hide secrets

pebbles

like eggs

on the riverbed

night owl hooting

near the barn

steals my silence

nougat bricks

marshmallow circles

cause my dentist to smile

glorious sun

shimmering orb

drying my wet shirt

lone telephone pole

standing silently pronounced

in carefree splender

She thinks that he will hurt me

I really hope not

Haiku's can be fun

But they can be confusing

Refrigerator

Flying butterfly,

emerging from the cocoon,

sad in the daylight.

Little shattered heart,

hanging, resisting, bleeding,

smiling in the dark.

The hill covered in

bare trees. The evening wind

rocks them gently.

Blowing in the wind

Leaves swirl in the cool breeze

Drifting in the streets

I create myself

In the image of my dreams

To at last be me

Windy Sea of shame:

My honor broken,

On the sidewalk-

so many earthworms

after the rain

A midnight speck of light

glimmers without hope

and the smoke leaves the ash without life

The taste

of the first summer rain

But sheilded and blocked by the black umbrella

This spring day--

behind the rain-clouds

a full moon

Can someone please help

I cannot view my haikus

That I made today

-------------------------------------------------------------

How do I do that

Please don't reply in haiku

Thank you for helping

I am getting good

At these things called haikus

Isn't that just perfect

softly my life's harmony
in deep agony.

Knowing death is near.

My favourite notes on flute

You tried to find the right words

No one else could say,

But courage was lacking.

in the darkness

I find peace and a pencil;

one is useless

Laying in my bed,

staring at the closed curtains.

Should I rise or not?



Your facebook page sucks!

Your bikini wax described

in Times Roman font.



While life slips away,

with narcassistic rapture,

you blather nonstop.





She came in the door

Time passed

Then she was gone.



Three stones together

Nestled in the earth

Morning dew sparkling.



Morning light

Shining thru the trees

Midnight moon.

Snowflakes dance outside

Resting on the window ledge

All is silent now

Not much fun--

cold night, asthmatic cough

and lonely Christmas:

no quiet place within

no fresh start for the New Year

Birds in flight through sunrise skies,
Winging through the dawn.
Feeling morning's warming rays.

to this day has always been

better than the past

What is a Dream?



Does a dream come true

when you wish upon a star

or is it false hope?



~Humantank11

Folded hands at rest;

The face in prayerful repose.

Breathing nevermore.

Rebellion

They will hold you back

unless you fight against them

to achieve freedom.

Weeping Willow Haiku

open window in a lonely cafe. the wind in my glass speaks volumes. who woke up instead of me today. 

My heart beats,

When you smile at me,

I'm falling for you.

Blank eyes staring,

Nothing left to cherish,

forever gone.

These ripe soybeans

silhouetted in sunlight-

rows of soldiers.



No cares and no sleep--

reckless thoughts without knowledge

that tomorrow nears

Rode

The simple sound of rain

Ahh, so butiful and graceful

the smell of sakura trees fill the air...

over lake's surface
watching black swans while soar up
through background of night

walking over noun

time moves forwards step by step
immediately it

Diamonds are sparkling,

Beautiful diamonds hiding

from the scalding sun.

Adventurous sport,

Neoprene clad looking good,

Dudes flock to surf spots.



Paddling with waves,

Standing with our feet apart,

Riding the surf in.



Tree thinks of Dearg,

Remembering the red board,

And sharing the waves.



Wiped out chaos,

Instinctively cradles head,

Ready to again.





My secrets haunt me,

The  large mistakes I have made,

Keep me up all night

Where were you before?

When i needed you the most

I felt forgotten

Your eyes are crystals

We made regrets together

Deep down, I'm sorry

The tears have started

They won't stop 'til you are here

Here, within my arms

You are beautiful

Don't let anyone tell you're not

They would be wrong, love

They stand all alone

Waiting to hear the gunshots

Dropping side by side

The waves roll higher

Towering over the sails

Crashing down fiercely.

What was I thinking?
Knew I shouldn't be driving...
God, I hope she lives...

Today is Wednesday

It will be very muggy

I will need water

brushed by barren boughs

September leaves painted in

the blush afterglow

daynight--

moonshadows 

washed in 

winter starlight

The parakeet sleeps

The monkeys ate bananas

The mouse laughed at them



Two beasts bear their fangs

A meal too meager to share

The law absolute



Moist icy tingle

Twisting gently down my skin

Drips from head to toe





Cooking on the grass

Cool sweat drops  starts to sizzle

My flesh starts to peel



Tension grasps my throat

Like a thirst that can't be quenched

Anticipation



Slapping, Sweating ,Gasp!

Touching, Grinding, Writhing

Your touch, Ecstasy!



Two second to go

A silent prayer is made

Buzz!!! We win it all….



All odds on their side

A moment's hesitation

They fear who we are



I let the ball fly

back of my throat, I taste it.

Victory, triumph!



A passing feeling

Behind my ear, a faint voice

Tragedy echoes



It just isn't fair

A brother taken too soon

But what can I do



A friend dearly missed

A brother taken too soon

A world left to mourn



---DREYGA2000

Spring

Sticky, oozing mud

Seeps into my soggy shoes

How I detest spring



Spring

Fresh buds sprout from soil

As rain sprinkles from the sky

Winter has now left



~Chrissy

On the sidewalk

the first worm of spring--

frozen and flat.



Rode

The computer's hum

reassures and reminds me

I am not alone.



Rode

feeling numb again. till the next victory then, the bitter taste lasts.

There sits here a cake



Smaller it slowly becomes



Its life sliced away

It's time to return

To see faces, I adored

The eyes, I avoid.

Pale walls of greed

Anxious beings voices tremble

rain-soaked frozen ground

an oppossum falls

Drifted snow encircles

Bluejays quarreling over crumbs;

A white cat watches.

Signs of spring hidden

Sitting on a rock

the immensity of the sea

- my small existence.

Walking along the beach

the waves - splash!

my skirt's wet.

Tormented by pain
The old man sighs his last breath
and walks in heaven.

swimming blind by great white shark

swimming for the light

swimming in the dark

Mind's dense witty dark lines grow pretty

up from garden

down to city.

Wound new's rubied, iron old's ruddy ;

red blood tastes rusty,

wet rust runs bloody.

Craziness.

You work hard at your work,

but that's a kind of laziness.

"Why's grapefruit, Rani, your favorite treat ?"

"It's like my life ---

bit bitter, bit sweet."

The mum you crush squawks no squawk ---

she yields her life

to perfume your walk.

Clock ticks endlessly

Time marches forever more

eternity hurts.

moonlit the night
dancing lingers on the wall
- glory of candle

auch durch Fichtenwald 
während eine jedem Schritt
weich raschelt Nadeln
★
by the spruce forest
with each footstep softly bend
the creaky needles

Have A Confession,
Roses Yours, Chocolate Yours, And
Diamonds Yours Too, You Mine.

A great two hour nap

so very rudely disturbed,

I will destroy all.

Life is cold and lonely

People leave

Time passes without going by.

I am not so proud
Heavy hands are stained with sins
This life is broken

As if sealed in glass

The frozen branches are still...

I am missing you.

With ice and darkness

The world is wounded again - 

You have gone away.



Haiku by Ilinca Bernea:







Frozen time of love
Like a standing wave
Like a boundless square...



*



Rising sun hidden
In the dust of past still shines
Through the dreams' hot wind



*



A savage snowfall
Your image like a deep trace
Cut into my soul


*

I’ve gained a mountain

At the lottery of stones

Once upon a time



*

Borderless sunset
Angels smiling through desert
Feeding my sunrise

*



Winter distant sun
My heaven captured in the
Summer rain silence


*



In the lake's mirror
Strange reflections of our lives
Bright and dark shadows


*

Wind and falling leaves
Our dreams going away
To nobody's land

*



My bleeding conscience
Covers in a painful breathe
The taste of your sin


*



Lights' rain beyond storm
Nothing changes for real

But somewhere inside...



*



Strange waving nature

Whispering leaves of the trees

Chasing the darkness



*



The violin's bow

touches the face of the sky

better than the wind



*

There is no false path

Only wrong steps following

The call of bad dreams



*

Goodness is no more

than the nature's symphony

whispered in the heart



* 



A flying machine

can have wings, can cross the sky

but never can sing



* 



Butterflies don‘t dies

they are as eternal as

everlasting dreams


* 



Each stone of the road

has been part of the body

of a big mountain



*



the starry night‘s peace

follows our destinies

like a magic lamp



*



is this a shadow

or the spirit of eagle

dancing with the clouds?



*



the soul's change of skin

tastes sometimes like grief or death

springtime comes with mud



* 

night of december

with no stars to beseech for

a bright destiny



*

is this a counter

for the bitterness of life

or just november?



*

somehow is early

somehow is late somehow is

just the right moment                   



*

today we are one

beyond sorrow and restless

gathered in a pray



*

the autumn gets dressed

in yellow green red purple

but its heart is gray



*

the salt of the earth

in not under the ground's skin

but into the sky



*



The trees are sometimes

As proud of the rain as men

of their conquests



*

Read the signs of time

in the shapes of the nature

the present is dust

Nothing like cliché’s

Five, seven and five again.

No exception’s here.

Words stop on my tongue,

Won’t pass through my fingertips.

Is this writer’s block?

Sweetmint bubblegum -


Your tired handbag carries


Secrets, so charming.



- P.

I silently watch

You smile. As the dreams shatter

Lips bend in reply.

as an outsider

with distance to self and much

more for the others

The moon goes from new to full;

Innocence is found

turtles washed to shore

divinity is present

lurking everywhere





rushing sea breezes

Scent of distant rain

chill wind, warm blanket

Fog, like grey ash, looms,

Lacks decisiveness of rain,

Hangs on my shoulder.

When I hear mom`s voice

I did not see her for years

I miss her so much

I'm getting older

again just like a flower

withers on the table

I look at the sky,

the sunshine is so dazzling,

and it is so hot.



My dog is missing,

so i look for it outside,

where are you right now?

English is too hard

but I want to try my best

learn, what I can learn

When I think of my

first bicycle I think of

my very first girl.

Why are you so mad?

is this that so important?

I didn't mean that.

summer is coming

sun is shining in our mind

my mind and your mind

Walking down the street

a nice smell comes around me

I think of my mom.

I wonder out loud

why you are not that perfect

well nobody is.

Life is full of joy

so make the most of it and

believe in true love.

Why can't I find you?

Where have you been all day son?

Let's enjoy the day

i might write a play

the concept is intriging

i fear the review

On sunday morning

the sky was lovely indeed

I went for a walk.







Love music for life

Music in many language

Dance sing and enjoy.



-Yariely Cabrera

Communication

Listening is the key to

Understanding you.



-Yariely Cabrera

old guy back in school

stretches brain to the limit

wonderful to do

you leave without me

i want to follow you but

just watching photos



hurrying to class

i was able to make it

but now sit sweating

i can see the end,

the finish line of this race;

i can see the end.

i see no roadway,
i see no path or crossroad,
am i to wander?

i found what i want,
what i need and what i want;
but life teases me.

where are the promises,
the stories we were told since birth;
is nothing real anymore?

i do not know where,
i have no knowledge or joy;
i am alone and empty.

in previous rain,

she offered me a cup of coffee

and a promise.

luxurious VIP room, heart patient, can't buy life

colourful nature

fades up quietly

absence often haunts

excess blessings,

empty heart,

God forgotton



Walk slowly through life

Look and feel and touch the earth

Notice the spaces.





See in between selves

Spaces are more important

Than what you think now.





Surface is not true

Beneath lies the essence of

Worth that is fleeting.





Only nothing counts

From nothing comes created

Surely we have to.





Stories are mindless

Better to read them than think

Of what we are best.

by HARRY SMALL



Tender green she is

"I shall enlighten!" she says

She stands and gazes down

silent cave
ocean of darkness
mysterious stories inside.

SUNDAY MORNING HAIKU (DILLON, COLORADO)

The soft crunch of snow,

mountains green, copper, gray, white—

my breath blows away.

Clouds gathered above

An invisible roof

soothes my dreams

"The Spring will come, yes it will"

So in love with you.

I think I'll write a poem,

maybe a haiku.

-Burton Munson

a sparrow bird

walking on the porch

with it's feet wet

when the party is over

the Night is silent

and I walk back home

the streetlights in a puddle

the stars in the dark sea

reflection and melancholy

walking in the rain

you open a umbrella, but

it doesn't protect your feet

a personal computer

in a room during power outage

technology becomes useless

infinity not
digested from long range
i eat the blue pill

a thaw -

crystal

flows

little birds play tag

around the grain on the ground,

why don't i play, too

Golden light rises,

Warming and dispersing joy,

On new beginnings.

The red strawberries

in the sink are ready to come

to my mouth good

During summer time,

the sun is glaring brightly,

and everyone is sweating

i looked oo so scared

the thought of love i had, gone

my tears from his slap.

Winter comes early,

so we can make snowman now,

it's a greatful time.

My heart beats for you.

Everyday I think of you.

I want to see you.

Guys Are Like Buses

Miss one catch the next fifteen

the art of a Bus

The stars in the sky;

carry the weight of my dreams,

how heavy it is!

Green, Blue, Taupe

the Peacock feathers I wore

Exotic ? I am !

Take me home today

but it will be tomorrow

I just say miss you

Walking on the moon

no one around to play with

this is very sad.

As I walk by him,

he can't help but stare at me.

It's human nature.

Thinking about you

has become a great pleasure

I don't want to loose

Fathers are like roots

Anchoring our children

And they will succeed

I'm the oldest here

I have fought longer with love

Lost every time.

The red strawberries

in the sink are ready to come

to my mouth now



you and I tangled

up in hotel sheets, basking

in sunlight and sin

thunderstorms all night
rain pounding on the windows
better than cardboard

all that matters is
not who loves you but whom you
have to give love to

I want to do this

to do my poetry good

and make it more whole!

Come and go softly

Leave me with new breath

Winds move forever

Orange light flickers

Shadows dancing on the wall

Kindred flames arise

Submission of seas

Waves crashing on lonely shore

Moonlight’s push and pull

To see the true light
we must transverse all blockades
clarity will come

The splendor of spring

Color explodes in view

Fragrance abounds

TITLE:  Trees with Icicles

Enter the valley
Frozen sentinels on guard
move quickly or freeze

AS the day unfolds

we bend and flow through our life

seeking harmony

Tranquil river flows

bidding good day to the earth

as it passes by

Peace comes at days end.
Lifes path traveled, well done
Breath released

Scent of rain on breeze

Shivers course across shoulders

It's coming, you know

Dark clouds scuttling

Over sweels rushing to shore

Gale storms across lake

Coyotes mournful yip

Distant dull roar of freeway

Suburban midnight

Shredded wheat in bowl

Glass and spoon and newspaper

.......Empty milk carton

New van for mommy

Tan Toyota Siena

Old car traded in

Nice guys finish last

At least thats what they all say

But they keep trying

Abandoned kittens

Humane Society kills

How is that HUMANE?

National Health Care

Social Security Dies

Thank you Washington

Let sleeping dogs lie

Its more fun to wake them up

Yawning and stretching

Toy Rat Terriers

Pit Bull attitudes

They think they are huge

Small black and white dog

Alligator in fur suit

He chews on my shoes



Little brown dog smiles

She loves to ride in the car

Hopes to see a cat

Too many lies told

Too few promises were kept

Time for a divorce



Big brown eyes watching

Just a puppy now

I will take you home



Sleep eludes me now

Memories smile sadly while

Passing in silence



Cry "Wolf" one more  time

No one will believe you now

You are on your own

Aggravation reigns

Drunk husband makes me insane

Illegal to kill

I look in mirror

Familiar stranger stares

She looks like my mom

Police pull speeders

My dog barks at them with glee

She thinks she's scary



Dawn breaks like an egg

Yellow yolk scrambled or poached

I'll have toast with mine 

Small dog is patient

He waits for his tasty treat

He wants it now



a singing lotus

no man would belong to me

nor I to one man

captain of marriage

the jeweled baby mirrors you

and bankrupts my days

good girl no more, no

my white veil masking nothing

white lips burn for you

she's a brown recluse

necrosis taking over

I bury your grave

your sperm - liquid gold

she's chained you with a baby

now this your martyrdom

he loves me with words

you torture me in solace

i find no freedom

Those big North Shore waves

Rolling in from cold waters,

Surfers' Salvation.

Summertime is here.

It makes me want to get out.

And enjoy the heat.

Goodbye father and
Goodbye to my sad mother,
I will be home soon.

Wai Fai

where is my new car

i believe my dad took it

why couldn't he have walked

out in the pastures

animals graze peacefully

cars drive past the farms

As a shinning sun

my mother is the light of

my life  , i love her

Birds can fly up high

Airplanes can even fly in sky

Why I can not fly?

The bird is flying

It flys high up in the sky

Hope it doesn't fall

My mother loves me.
She has a wonderful soul.
Nothing upsets her.

The city is big

I find myself lost a lot

But always get home

Summer in New York

After the cold long winter

It's all we deserve

Class is interesting

The professor is really rocks

Summer school is cool

winter is leaving

summer is knocking the doors

welcome to the world

I fell asleep to
soft rustling of the tree leaves
on that summer's eve 

Nowadays are rough

Evereything is very up

Money even tough

the week is midway

i cant wait for the weekend

only a few days

Please show my Haiku,

so i can go get some food,

but it takes time right?

wai fai

As I close my eyes

I can hear her raspy voice

Saying I'm so sorry

I know I can fly.

Fly with my lovely boy.

Let us fly up high.

Will it rain today?

I hope it comes down heavy

so i can stay in



My mom became old

Brown hair is now turning gray

Changes are scary

I wake up early
the sun in not yet risen
please, five more minutes

in the precipice
the shadow of the stone
falls first

(Carlos Seabra)

The small wooden boat creaks,

Oars slip in tired hands – Splash

Sweat rolls down the neck

In the village tank

A shred of mud pot

Teaching dancing skills to waves

Pictures in darkrooms.

I capture your essence, flash.

Still-framed valentine.

Fiddle  symphony

Contemporary in night

Synched, as words I write

A little sushi

Now I send my taste buds away

In Japan that's great

the sunset

Bright is the sunset

a gorgeous mix of colors

a perfect days end

Mark your calendar,
Tell me to not count the days;

Two weeks until love.

black is beautiful

we can be gracious and sweet

we are plain unique

4th of July

Going to the lake

Cooking hot dogs and burgers

Watching fireworks

spring when flowers grow

tullups, roses,deandelions,

without spring they wouldn't grow

beautiful dadelions  blow

in the sky, their seeds get blown

new dandelions grow

STUDY

I study all day

And I study all night

I hate to study

Riding Horses

The wind in my face

Riding freely in pastures

Riding on Sally


Tubing in the Lake

Roughly on the waves

Grit your teeth and hold on tight

Falling off is fun

Seven dead People

Only one to blame this on

The silent killer

Cancer

Little butterfly

are you also grieving now :

as flowers whither

Now the darkness falls

Engulfing me in darkness

Silence is beauty

Long twisted fingers

reach out to the night sky

All is deadly still

pain like a dagger

cuts, pierces, tears apart, wounds, hurts

really crushes me

Now the darkness falls

surrounding me with its black

it's me and you here

The sun is shining

no more winter, no more rain

spring has come back home

April Sunday dawns -

Roses resting in the road -

Prom night's glass slipper.

My house is no more

My money is all gone now

Vegas is so fun



Sunrise on bare trees

in Spring birdsong awakens

Composing haiku

While driving down the freeway -

The fog is lifting

You slice through the wind

Sharp as winters breath

A loyal weapon                      

(KATANA)

Spring sun through window

warms sleepy cat

my chair covered in hair

Cherry blossoms bloom

They are pretty in winter

But best in spring

The thunder booms loudly

The ground is wet and muddy

Looks like no recess

waves crash against walls

walls fall so slowly downward

downward turns upward

it felt like waking

you found me in a lost world

now I'm a princess

two hands together

feeling temporary warmth

begin touching keys

dark morning...
the sushi bar opens up
for the train station

Whiteness overwhelms

Like an overnight snowfall

Hard to leave brushstrokes

Too tall to see more

Sky - the trees have grown

The picnic grows cold

The plum's weight falls hard

As the rain remains steady

The dog goes walking

Secrecy prevails

Responsibility wanes

Logic is betrayed

knocking at the door

death came to visit and stayed awhile

when he left dad

spring snowflakes

on an open stream -

dreams fade quickly

twitterverse haiku

my life a poem for you

smiles on strangers

wind chimes

or distant church bells

- april breeze secrets

awakened -

sidewalk puddle

by a single droplet

porch rocking -

old man whittles

shavings fall in silence

The cold breezy day
So miserable and grey
The rain is falling

Brain on fire, bright
Scattered pieces, fractal view
Kaleidoscope life

Monument to doubt
She stays for life's mysteries
Wanders, aimlessly

Real, imagined fear
Must not stop, it's drawing near
Real, imagined fear

Warring thoughts like knights
Sword concepts wielded and strike
Severed reasoning

Flowers that have dew

Shiny like a mirror, and

They drop on the ground

The wind sways along

Bamboo brushing against me

Hear it howl now

kakashiblackdragon@gmail.com

Curving up, then down.

Meeting blue sky, then green earth.

Melding sun and rain.



Birds take wing on high

gliding over angry waves

back to their safe nests



Sunrise in the east

Sunset in the winter west

Always brought men's best

Nightingale singing

Unlike the church chime ringing

Brought glee and dancing



Mighty lioness

Where is thy throne and prowess?

Crying in disgrace

The heat of sunlight

Warmth and gave all things delight

Tomorrow is bright

Swaying bamboo leaves

Dancing the rhythm of Jazz

Confident at last

Falling leaves of trees

Brown, yellow and sometimes green

A true life story

These sun-soaked grapes

weave a lush purple carpet--

my royal road. 

Living in the books,

every day's a new story.

Then comes non-fiction.

I have maple syrup

You have eggs, flour, sugar

Where's baking soda?

Empty glasses shrink,

never to be filled again

by such awful joy.

The weathered white wall

run down by simplicity

was all we hoped for.

Answering questions

for the sake of good letters.

This won't change my life.

nature



clouds sit still above

clear seas arround the mountains

nature's beauty glows

Restless late at night,

the faintest sounds keep me up.

So I write Haiku.

nature~~~



clouds sit still above,

limpid sea surrounds mountains,

nature's beauty glows.

cherry blossom~~~



pink,fragrant flowers,

sweet intoxicating scent,

blooming in mid spring

Dawn. A bum rises

from a parkbench to wash:

walking barefoot in dew.

A grackled elm

melts sleep from these lazy eyes,

filling warm noon with screams.

Down dry, wintry well,

He dropped his bucket. Thud! Splash!

Not empty: frozen.

Clicking on window panes,

Sleet wakes me from dreams of snow:

silent, falling snow

coldness



A cold windy night

blows a blue sea full of ice

and many sleeping ducks.



Chase

green follage bursting

a brown deer runs out

a red arrow chasing

we all pass through life's

storms, cyclones and volcones

to seize souls and selves

gopichand&nagasuseela



waves of life consume

By living and enliving

the values we possess

Catnip Day Today:
Beware all felines alert
More than usual.

Never love at all?
Better to have loved and lost?
No broken heart, please.

red and blue

colors are truly magnificint

The Evening

Another Beginning

Refreshing, Enchanting

arrows fly in cold

they search, they think, they look up!

clouds pass by blue sky

Pale cottonwoods wreathed

in fall’s amber hue.  Golden

leaves kissed by light.



Winged imprints in

snow.  An instant caught, yet

lost forever, come Spring.

Off to the Beer Fest

Hops, Barley, Water and Yeast

To My Palates Joy

tiny red flower

the liquid called dew in new

like a tear it falls

(renesmee_cullen10@yahoo.com)

leaves are colorful

they slowly float in the breeze

falling upon me

Dripping down my wall

Rains of spring and winters fall

Streaming in the drain

whispering inside

words and feelings in my mind

mental waves I see

dixie is flying

its in our souls forever

it will never die

the south is coming

we will retake what was ours

it is overdue

wrong, right

a frog disturbs the
moon’s mirror in old pond
a cloud drifts in time

Wait, take a deep breath

There, right there did you feel it

Now I understand

Qiuet sparrow squints

holding on to frozen limbs

facing northern winds

The birds said to me

If found frozen on a branch

never once felt sorry

The night lightens

And the pillow is cold

Morning whispers lies

Haiku (alert-lazy)

on the few tea-drops

I put out the cigarette 

me alert-lazy

Haiku's are very fun.

Sometimes they do not make sense.

Refrigerator.

A clown bursts open

Flames reach the funny red wig

NO candy for you!

let's not let

'not yet'

be said of us

Bike race

Legs burning...cranking
All out, wheel to wheel...waiting
In there head...winning

Open fire cooking
With twinkling stars overhead
marshmallows roasting

our first spring

sunrise

a rainbow

Beautiful flowers

you fill the sky with colors

so bright and pretty

(april and felicia)

Oh shiny rainbow

you fill the sky with colors

so bright and pretty


empty highway -- dead crow
in the overtaking lane

~~~ (Gina)



closed window
the cat disappears
into fog

~~~ (Gina)


a blackbird
tugs at the worm --
both stretching

~~~ (Gina)


a blue moon
the world can wait
for once



~~~ (Gina)

Once you’ve seen the whale,

The other fish may look like

A trifling affaire.

Haiku ( home)

sun going down, swift

a tiny bird rests en route

- must get to home, fast

I sit in my shell

hopelessly divided

I am lost here



Palm trees are swaying

Oh-so gently in the wind

Lush waves crash over the sand



Dismantaling you

is easy, it takes one screw

remodel is tough

The 1, 2, 3, go

uptown, but I am going

straight to Brooklyn

Haiku (balanced buoyancy)

a log in the stream.
a man stood on its corner.
the hollow log floats.

Modern American Haiku
It's a bird,
It's a plane,
It's …Superman!

Haiku sharing joy

View in sparsity of words

Crystalized exchange

profile loads slowly
too many applications
now under boxes
-Anthonie Sioco

Dew drops glistening

Like thousands of diamonds

In the early light

Precipitation
Brings more anticipation
and contemplation.

i want one hard kiss
one barefoot dance in paris
when the lights go out
- laurie macfayden

today, loving her
is like shards of glass, swallowed
slowly, she hurts me

ha i had sugar

and ha you can't have any

oh wait this is salt

The moon is shining

like a great, golden Buhdda

hanging in the sky

-Jim Spaulding

now a days picking

up a penny ain't

a bad idea

cool morning sun

Sampaguita clusters beam

under light shower

CUPCAKE BAKESHOP

Tiny baked goodies

A little taste of heaven

Who doesn't want one?

The white trash boys sit

outside the convenience store

blasting just white noise

gently weeping girl
she waits for no one, too long
the crows caw, and fly
